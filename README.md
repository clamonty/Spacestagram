# Make Commerce Better for Everyone 
This app allows users to search for photos from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API. Users can like their favorite photos and have them persist on page load, as well as select a starting date from which to view all of NASA's pictures to the current date. Users can also at any point read more about any photo, showing the date it was taken, the photographer source, as well as a description of the image.
